# MiniEcosystemSimulation
Matplotlib.animation simulation of an ecosystem of plants and animals, and their interconnectedness. The simulation has 28 adjustable parameters so far.

# 27 Adjustable Parameters
This program is made in a way that is as dynamic as possible. Meaning, with maybe 5 +-1 lines of code a new species, plant or animal, can be added into the simulation. The 27 paramters can be tuned by chaning a number in order to change things such as how fast a species moves, how fast plants spawn, how much resource is kept by a predator when eating prey, how much energy is lost when given to a child, and many more. I will later add in the parameters and what they do.
